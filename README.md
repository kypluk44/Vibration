# Vibration Game: Personalized AI Agent Web Game

This project is a web-based game designed to enhance user engagement with 'Energogarant' insurance products. It features personalized AI agents for each user, leveraging LangGraph on a Python backend, to generate unique stories, daily scenarios, and tailored advice. The frontend is built with React and TypeScript.

## Project Goal

To create an engaging web application where users interact with personalized AI-driven narratives, encouraging exploration of insurance products through interactive scenarios and rewards.

## Key Technologies

*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, Zustand, React Query
*   **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, LangGraph, Redis, PostgreSQL
*   **AI:** LangGraph for personalized agent creation and management

## Overview

The game provides each user with a unique AI agent that evolves based on their interactions. Daily scenarios, mini-games, and insurance-related advice are generated by the agent. Users can earn rewards, build streaks, and collect items, all managed by their personal AI agent on the server.
